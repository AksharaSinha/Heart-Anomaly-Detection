# Heart-Anomaly-Detection
The objective of the study is to implement deep learning methods for detecting heart anomalies by classifying them into four different categories using heart audio recordings.
The dataset is from a machine learning challenge, originating from two sources â€“ general public audio recordings using an iPhone app, and clinical trials in hospitals. Two datasets are used, one containing 176 audio files in wav format, and another containing 656 audio files in wav format. The former is a labeled data with four categories (normal heart and four (potentially) anomalous heart conditions). The latter is a labelled data with three categories (normal and two anomalous heart conditions).
